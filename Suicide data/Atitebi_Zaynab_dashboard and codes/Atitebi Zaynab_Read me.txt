TASK 1- DASHBOARD DEVELOPMENT
In this task, I made a comparative analysis of the suicide rate between some selected countries using the powerBi app. you can find visualizations that shows the total population by countries, top and bottom 5 suicidal countries, suicidal rate by gender, year on year population growth by countries and a forecast of the suicide rate. On the home page, you will find the title of the dashboard and some KPI's.
Also, below is a lin k to the report pn my powerBi service for your perusal.

TASK 2- STATISTICAL ANALYSIS
Here, the R statistical tool was used to do a descriptive statistics of the same data used in Task 1. Also, a correlation and regression analysis was carried out to look at how correlated the attributes are and the independent attribute that is significantly correlated with the dependent variable. I also did a time series analysis for the population growth in Japan since it happens to be the mtopmost suicidal country. And finally, I did a comparative analysis of the suicide rate between the developed and underdeveloped countries, and realized there was a significant difference in the suicide rate between those two groups.
